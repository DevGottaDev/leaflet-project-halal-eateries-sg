# leaflet-project-halal-eateries-sg
leaflet map project using scraped data from MUIS for all halal eateries in sg

todo: 
layer clustering
routing?
add features to search? possibly build own search instead of plugin?

icons? - change? is the color theme fine?
pictures in popup - styling

possibly investigate idea about why map isnt loading before clusters - may  need to decouple code
