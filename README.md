## Project Summary

"Halal Go Where?" is a mobile-responsive front-end web application that aims to allow users to view and explore MUIS-certified Halal eateries located in Singapore.

### Why make this application?  
Currently, there exists only a few resources with which Muslims living in Singapore can use to find places to eat. They are the official MUIS [website](https://www.muis.gov.sg/Halal/Halal-Certification/Certified-Eating-Establishments#) and the MuslimSG application. However both sources come with the downsides. MUIS's site only allows the user to check if a restaurant is halal certified and the MuslimSG application only works if downloaded and installed on a compatible device. Halal Go Where? (Refered to from here on HGW) allows the user to access an interactive leaflet-map based application from any device with a browser.

### User Story
| User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| I want to easily locate a halal eatery near me | Geolocator clickable option in map to allow user to center the map on them |
| I want to easily locate a halal eatery near a specific location | Search bar with auto-complete/auto-suggest feature that allows the user to center the map on the target location |
| I want to be able to easily identify the cuisine of the halal eateries near my chosen location | Map markers are dynamically generated using Foursquare's api to more accurate depict the cuisine of the point of interest |
| I want to get the exact address of the halal eatery i am interested in | Map markers have a popup on hover that displays the eatery's address as awell as a small preview image of the food/restaurant |

### Goals  
This app is targeted at Muslims living in Singapore as well as any potential Muslim visitors to Singapore such as tourists etc. The app also aims to help support halal-ceritfied establishments by raising awareness of their existence, helping to keep them in business, allowing for more diversity in menu options for Muslim consumers.
